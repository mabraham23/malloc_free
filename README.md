# Malloc and Free Implementation

### \*Mark Abraham

This is my implementation of Malloc and Free for Xv6. Malloc in C enables users to allocate more memory for declared variables. And 'Free' allows you to release the memory that was reserved. Implementing an OS native function like this was very educating and highlighted several intersting programming paradigms.
